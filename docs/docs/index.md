# Cupcake Catalog

Cupcake Catalog is the official registry for discovering and sharing reusable [Cupcake](https://cupcake.eqtylab.io/) rulebooks. Install pre-built policy bundles with a single command, or publish your own rulebooks for the community.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Search for available rulebooks
cupcake catalog search

# Install a rulebook
cupcake catalog install security-hardened

# List installed rulebooks
cupcake catalog list
```

## What is a Rulebook?

A rulebook is a packaged collection of Cupcake policies that can be installed and used across projects. Rulebooks provide:

- **Pre-built policies** for common use cases (security, compliance, best practices)
- **Multi-harness support** with policies for Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, and Factory
- **Version management** with semver support and automatic upgrades
- **Namespace isolation** so catalog policies don't conflict with project policies

## Featured Rulebooks

| Rulebook | Description | Harnesses |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `security-hardened` | Block dangerous commands, flags, and destructive Git operations | All |

## How It Works

1. **Browse** the catalog to find rulebooks that match your needs
2. **Install** rulebooks with `cupcake catalog install <name>`
3. **Policies activate** automatically when you run Cupcake
4. **Upgrade** to newer versions with `cupcake catalog upgrade`

Installed rulebooks are stored in `.cupcake/catalog/` and evaluated as an overlay between your global and project policies.
